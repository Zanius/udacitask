# -------------------------------------------------------

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------

1. How long did you spend working on this project?


Several hours of the course of 3 or 4 days.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Figuring out the merge function for hashes so I could pass multiple hashes into a method.


3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

a. I added user input functionality. It seemed like a logical choice, and the way I did it guides the user into inputting correct formats without so many errors.

b. I displayed the priority type instead of just the arrows because the arrows don't appear as valid characters for windows users because a red question mark was very confusing.



4. Where do you still have room to grow?

I feel like I could use modules more effectively when I code on my own time.
